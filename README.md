# FullstackInterview

Hi there stranger - we're the devs of the company you're applying for. This little repo seems big at first, but it's really not. We've knitted together a nice little coding "challenge" for you to kick off our technical interview with you.

In order to not put too much pressure on you, you should have gotten the option to prepare this up front and might read this on your own right now. That's fine, let's introduce you to this repo.

This repo has two basic skeletons already prepared for you, the server and the client side - as follows:

## Server Side (Backend)

This is more relevant to you if you are going to apply for a backend position. Please have a look into the [./apps/api/README.md](./apps/api/README.md)

## Client Side (Frontend)

This is more relevant to you if you are going to apply for a frontend position. Please have a look into the [./apps/web-app/README.md](./apps/web-app/README.md)
